Just some shell/bash-scripts I use or made for various reasions. Some of them initially made for others, as helpers, but most for my own usage. I'll try to make a separate `readme.md` for each script.

### Location

Most scripts lives in `~/ShellScripts` (it's good practice to use a common folder), while other scripts are put in `/usr/local/sbin` - which is almost empty on OS X, and where some other programs put their stuff.

It's always good to add that path to PATH _(see /dotfiles/.bashrc)_

	# export PATH.
	export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"


_...and don't forget to `chmod +x` the files._
