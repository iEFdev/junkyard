SHASUM

> _bash script/wrapper for shaNNNsum_


This is just a _dirty hack_ to get "shasum" onboard my Linux machine(s). Linux have "shaNNNsum", so as a wrapper &/or to use with other scripts as a layer.

It doesn't bring all options, but the 3 options are:

|                   |                                 |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------ |
| `-a, --algorithm` | 1 (default), 224, 256, 384, 512 |
| `-s, --status`    | OS X has an xtra `-s`           |

Besides that, use it as normal.
