Just a few shell/bash-scripts I use or made for various reasions. Some of them initially made for others, as helpers, but most for my own usage. I'll try to make a separate `readme.md` for each script.

### Locations

Most scripts lives in `~/ShellScripts` (it's good practice to use a common folder), while other scripts are put in `/usr/local/xbin`. For custom made scripts I use a separate folder to keep them out from other ones.

Add xbin to PATH _(see /dotfiles/.bashrc)_


	# export PATH.
	export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/xbin:$PATH"

Don't forget to `chmod +x` your files.
