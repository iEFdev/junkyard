# Junkyard

![][license]

Just a few shell/bash-scripts I use or made for various reasions. Some of them initially made for others, as helpers, but most for my own usage. I'll try to make a separate `readme.md` for each script. They are in the [Wiki][wiki].

Most are made for(/on) OS X, but could work on other platforms as well. I'll keep a few ones in a Linux folder.
